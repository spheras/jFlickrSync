# jFlickrSync
Flickr Synchronization made with Java

jFlickrSync is a console application that allows you to synchronize all the content you have at flickr with your local storage drive. This way you can add/remove photos from your local drive and the new content will be added/removed at your server account.

In order to start using jFlickrSync you will need to allow this app to get and modify the content of your flickr account following the instructions it gives the first time. For sure, you can ensure that the application doesn't use your data for a different thing than the explained here, and the best way to confirm this is getting the code: Long Llive The Open source!

Anyway, becareful using this application as it tries to sync the information but sometimes things are difficult to sync, and the flickr api doesn't allow to see changes easily :(.  My local tests and personal test with my own account seems to work perfect.
